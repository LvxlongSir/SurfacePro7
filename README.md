Thanks to all giants. I would share my plus here:
1. don't change air to pro, otherwise TF not working;
2. add SMCProcessXXX, you'll be able to read CPU tempreture=> https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/releases;
3. see BigSurface.kext 's auther, he managed to make touch screen & stylus work => https://github.com/Xiashangning/IPTSDaemon;
4. zsh: event not found: /bin/bash ?????? => chmod +xbalabala.sh ;
5. Change your UUID's last 12 digits to be same as en0 mac address, enables share copy/paste across devices, imessage, etc.;
6. BIOS should only enable InternalStorge, only 1. Otherwise you may see strange booting result;
7. remove red lock see here -> https://github.com/badstorm/surface-pro-7-opencore/blob/master/SecureBoot.With.Grub.md;
8. OpenCore Configurator => https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/opencore-configurator/#disqus_thread;
9. Ventura pretty and Sonoma >14.3 so far no good;
10. sudo /Volumes/16T_History/MacOS/Install\ macOS\ Ventura.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume  /Volumes/UP /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Ventura.app â€“nointeraction
11. see this to utilize stylus -> https://github.com/Xiashangning/IPTSDaemon and I tuned parameter in fork: https://github.com/LvxlongSir/IPTSDaemon This would make touch screen with multi-gestures and three fingers drag&drop smooth
